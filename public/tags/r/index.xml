      <description>CONSORT (Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) diagrams are commonly included in the reporting of clinical trials, where they are essentially used to track the flow of participants though different subgroups over the course of the trial. More information can be found at the CONSORT website (linked here). I recently needed to draw a CONSORT diagram, and while looking around at the various R packages that can be used to do this I also found an RPubs blog article written by Peter Higgins (linked here), in which he describes a method for drawing a CONSORT diagram using Râ€™s ggplot2 package.</description>
